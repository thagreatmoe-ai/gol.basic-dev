GoL v6.4
- Fix: When Quantity = "times", the per-day target now respects your entered value (e.g., 3 times shows progress 0/3, 1/3, etc.).
- Change: For daily/one-time tasks, period target is ignored and no longer saved; only the per-day target is used.
- Notes: All other features from v6.3 remain.
